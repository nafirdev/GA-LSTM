# GA-LSTM: Intelligent Time Series Forecasting with Keras & Genetic Algorithms

**GA-LSTM** is an intelligent forecasting engine that combines the power of *deep learning* (LSTM networks via **Keras**) with the evolutionary search capabilities of **Genetic Algorithms (GA)**. This project is built to automatically discover the *optimal hyperparameters* for time series prediction tasks—without manual tuning, guesswork, or trial-and-error.

Whether you're working with stock market data, IoT sensors, or sales forecasting, GA-LSTM adapts, evolves, and delivers results.

## Why This Project Stands Out

* **Hybrid Intelligence**: Merges *Keras-powered LSTM models* with a *Genetic Algorithm* that mimics natural selection to evolve better model configurations over time.
* **Fully Automated Optimization**: No manual tuning needed—this engine finds the best learning rate, layer sizes, number of LSTM cells, and input window sizes for you.
* **Domain Agnostic**: Easily adaptable to a wide range of time series problems (finance, weather, energy, etc.).
* **Keras Simplicity, TensorFlow Power**: Built on **Keras**, running on **TensorFlow**—ensuring robust performance and intuitive model design.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

Install required packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn
```

### Run the Model

```bash
python GA-LSTM.py
```

The script automatically runs the Genetic Algorithm to find the best LSTM configuration, trains the model, and prints performance metrics.

## How It Works

This project uses a **Genetic Algorithm** to evolve combinations of LSTM hyperparameters, evaluating each based on model accuracy. Here's how it operates:

1. **Define Search Space**:

   * Neurons per LSTM layer (50–200)
   * Learning rate (0.001–0.01)
   * Number of layers (1–3)
   * Input window size (10–60 time steps)

2. **Generate Initial Population**: Random combinations of parameters

3. **Evaluate Fitness**: Each configuration trains a Keras LSTM and is scored (e.g., with Mean Squared Error)

4. **Selection, Crossover, Mutation**:
   Just like biology—survival of the fittest.

5. **Convergence**: The process repeats until the best-performing model is found.

## Example Output

After execution, you’ll get something like:

```
Best Configuration:
- Units: 120
- Layers: 2
- Learning Rate: 0.005
- Window Size: 30
MSE on Validation Set: 0.00231
```
